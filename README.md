# Learn Data Structure & Algorithms in Go

Chapter 1

Data Structures and Algorithms, focuses on the definition of abstract data types, classifying data structures into linear, non-linear, homogeneus, heterogeneous, and dynamic types. Abstract data types, such as container, list, set, map, graph, stack, and queue, are presented in this chapter. This chapter also covers the performance analysis of data structures, as well as the correct choice of data structures and structural design patterns.

Chapter 2

Getting Started with Go for Data Structures and Algorithms, covers Go-specific data structures, such as arrays, slices, two-dimencional slices, maps, structs, and channels. Variadic functions, deferred function calls, and panic and recover operations are introduced. Slicing operations, such as enlarging using append and copy, assigning parts, appending a slice, and appending part of a slice, are also presented in this chapter.

Chapter 3

Linear Dtat Structures, covers linear data structures such as list, sets, tuples, stacks, ans heaps. The operations related to these types, including insertion, deletion, updating, reversing, and merging are shown with various code samples. In this chapter, we present the complexity analysis of various data structure operations that disply accessing, search, insertion and deleting times.

Chapter 4

Non-linear Data Structures, covers non-linear data structures, such trees, tables, containers, and hash functions. Tree types, including binary tree, binary search tree, T-tree, treap, symbol table, B-tree, and B+ tree, are explanied with code examples and complexity analisys. Hash function in cryptography for a variety of scenarios, such as open addressing, linear probing, universal hashing, and double hashing.

Charpter 5

Homogeneous Data Structures, covers homogeneous data structures such as two-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays. Array shapes, types, literals, printing, construction, indexing, modification, transformation, and views area presented together with code examples and performance analysis. Matrix representation, multiplication, addition, subtraction, inversion, and transpoce scenarios area shown to demonstrate the usage of multi-dimentional arrays.

Chapter 6

Heterogeneous Data Structures, covers heterogeneous data structures, such as linked lists, ordened, and unordered lists. We present the singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list, along with code samples and efficiency analysis. Ordered and unordered lists from HTML 3.0 area shown to demonstrate the usage of lists storage management.
