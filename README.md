# Learn Data Structure & Algorithms in Go

Chapter 1

Data Structures and Algorithms, focuses on the definition of abstract data types, classifying data structures into linear, non-linear, homogeneus, heterogeneous, and dynamic types. Abstract data types, such as container, list, set, map, graph, stack, and queue, are presented in this chapter. This chapter also covers the performance analysis of data structures, as well as the correct choice of data structures and structural design patterns.

Chapter 2

Getting Started with Go for Data Structures and Algorithms, covers Go-specific data structures, such as arrays, slices, two-dimencional slices, maps, structs, and channels. Variadic functions, deferred function calls, and panic and recover operations are introduced. Slicing operations, such as enlarging using append and copy, assigning parts, appending a slice, and appending part of a slice, are also presented in this chapter.
